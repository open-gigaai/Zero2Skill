This skill schedules other skills for self-learning. Repository root is `$ZERO2SKILL_ROOT`.

## Workflow

2. Write analysis results to `analyze_result.yaml` in this directory (see `analyze_result.example.yaml`).

## Attention

2. Follow the steps strictly.
3. On any error message, do not fix it yourself; ask the user for help immediately.
