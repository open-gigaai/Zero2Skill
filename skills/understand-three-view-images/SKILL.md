# understand-three-view-images

This skill understands images from the robot head, left-arm, and right-arm cameras. It auto-captures view images, runs a multimodal model, and returns an environment understanding result.

Before running, set `ARK_API_KEY` (or `VOLCENGINE_API_KEY`) and `source $ZERO2SKILL_ROOT/configs/paths.env`.

## Capabilities
- Understand three-view / front-view image content and return current environment understanding
- BBox prompt variant: `scripts/auto_understand_images_bbox.sh`

## Workflow
Use `scripts/auto_understand_images.sh --prompt "Please describe the current desktop scene"` to get environment understanding. The script auto-captures images and calls the understanding script.
